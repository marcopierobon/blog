As you know, there's a humanitarian crisis going on in Ukraine and your help is urgently needed.

 

> This winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine.


*\- Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe*



**SITUATION:**

Ukraine is facing a harsh winter with temperatures that will reach -20°C, and that are on average below 0 on 105 days/year.

 

The energy infrastructures are heavily damaged:

* All of the 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine have been taken out from the network due to a decrease in frequency, a situation that is likely to happen *[over and over](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2348196-ukraines-nuclear-plants-face-uncertain-future-after-russian-attacks/)*.
* 40% of the Kyiv (Kiev) oblast is still without electricity.
* Ukraine’s Ministry for Communities and Territories Development said that as of Sept. 22, 349 pieces of critical heating infrastructure had been damaged in the war.
* Apart from heating plants, thousands of miles of heating-system pipelines *[are vulnerable to artillery and airstrikes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-home-heating-network-threatened-by-russian-attacks-11666399886)*.
* People in Kyiv (Kiev) are queuing to collect water from public wells in the pouring rain.
* The pace of restoration to household consumers is slowed down by difficult weather conditions made worse by the freezing and rupture of wires in distribution networks.
* As a testimony to the impossible situation, surgeons had to perform *[heart surgery](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2125368899988/)* on a child using a torch light as a blackout occurred.
* According to the United Nations in the south of Ukraine, people have no water, electricity or heat, and food is scarce.
